% This function takes a single channel of data and learns appropriate
% detection parameters for it individually.

%Inputs:
% data - a vector containing prerecorded data

%Outputs:
% v_height - the appropriate magnitude threshold for detecting ventricular peaks
% a_height - the appropriate magnitude threshold for detecting atrial peaks
% v_flip - sign of data that should be examined for ventricuar peaks (+1 or -1)
% a_flip - sign of data that should be examined for atrial peaks (+1 or -1)
% v_length - the duration (in samples) a ventricular peak must occur in (see yamPeakFinder)
% a_length - the duration (in samples) an atrial peak must occur in (see yamPeakFinder)
% v_first - boolean value that is true if we should detect ventricles first
%           before looking for atria, false otherwise
